description: Computes validation metrics from a vector agreement dataset (GeoPackage Points/MultiPoints) containing tagged points (e.g., High Water Marks) and saves them to a JSON file. Assumes points have attributes indicating agreement status or values derived from comparison with a benchmark raster.

    description: |
      Path/URI where the calculated validation metrics for the points dataset will be saved as a JSON file.
      The JSON file will contain an object with performance metrics derived from the point-based comparison, potentially including:
      ```json
      {
        "points_total": <integer>,
        "points_agree": <integer>,
        "hit_rate": <number between 0 and 1>, // Equivalent to POD for points
        "mean_absolute_error": <number>, // If comparing depth values
        "rmse": <number> // If comparing depth values
        // Other relevant point-based metrics
      }
      ```
      (Note: Specific metrics like CSI/POD/FAR might be adapted or different metrics might be more suitable for point validation depending on the exact attributes available).
