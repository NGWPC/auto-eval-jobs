description: Computes validation metrics (e.g., CSI, POD, FAR) from a raster agreement map (GeoTIFF in EPSG:5070) and saves them to a JSON file. Assumes specific pixel values represent agreement categories based on the preceding agreement step.
outputTransmission:
  - value
  - reference

inputs:
  agreement_path:
    title: Raster Agreement Map Path
    description: Path/URI to the input raster agreement map (GeoTIFF) in CONUS Albers (EPSG:5070). Pixel values should encode agreement results (e.g., from raster_raster_agreement component).

      Path/URI where the calculated validation metrics will be saved as a JSON file.
      The JSON file will contain an object with performance metrics derived from the raster comparison:
      ```json
      {
        "csi": <number between 0 and 1>,
        "pod": <number between 0 and 1>,
        "far": <number between 0 and 1>
        // Other metrics
      }
      ```
      Where:
      - `csi`: Critical Success Index
      - `pod`: Probability of Detection (Hit Rate)
      - `far`: False Alarm Ratio
    schema:
      type: string
