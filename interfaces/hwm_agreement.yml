id: hwm_agreement
description: Compares benchmark high water mark points against a candidate raster dataset. Determines agreement by performing a proximity analysis at each point location. Produces an output vector dataset (GeoPackage) in EPSG:5070 containing the tagged points, optionally clipped.

outputTransmission:
  - reference

arguments:
  fim_type:
    title: FIM Type for Agreement
    description: Specifies whether agreement is based on checking if points fall within the raster's spatial 'extent' (binary) or extracting the raster's 'depth' value at the point location. Influences output vector attributes.
    schema:
      type: string
      enum: [extent, depth]
      default: extent
